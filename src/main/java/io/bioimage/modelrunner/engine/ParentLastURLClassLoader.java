 * Custom classloader that acts as an URL classloader that tries to load first the classes in

 * This was necessary because the Javacpp Loader looked for the JARs added to the engine classloader
 * to look for the directories where the native libraries where (inside the JAR file).
 * Due to the special classloading protocol in Fiji, the engine classloader never added 
 * the JARs to the classpath, thus the native libraries were never found. With a child-first/parent-last
 * the classes from the JARs are always loaded on the child classloader (engineclassloader) making its 
 * classpath include the JARs that contain the native libraries.
 * See  org.bytedeco.javacpp#findResources at line 894 to find the conflicting part, where
 * if the classloader was not parent-last, the needed resource was not found
